I'd like to apologize to the Echols family and others for posting a pic of their kids w/o permission.I didn't mean to cause them distress.
A trillion dollars buys a lot of expert opinions. Will it buy you? TOXIN FREE VACCINES, A REASONABLE REQUEST! http://t.co/GTr9lReaXO
TOXIN FREE VACCINES, A REASONABLE REQUEST! http://t.co/GTr9lReaXO
All we are saying is,"Take the neurotoxins out of the vaccines." Make them toxin free.History will show that that was a reasonable request.
I repeat! I AM PRO-VACCINE/ANTI-NEUROTOXIN, as is Robert Kennedy Jr. Please read the following article and book http://t.co/GTr9lReaXO
I am PRO-VACCINE/ANTI-NEUROTOXIN, Get that straight. http://t.co/gbh58Unyvo
Go to http://t.co/SlY91SQmCj watch the documentary and judge for yourselves. If you really care about the kids you will. It's shocking!
The CDC can't solve a problem they helped start. It's too risky to admit they have been wrong about mercury/thimerasol. They are corrupt.
I am not anti-vaccine. I am anti-thimerosal, anti-mercury. They have taken some of the mercury laden thimerosal out of vaccines. NOT ALL!
They say mercury in fish is dangerous but forcing all of our children to be injected with mercury in thimerosol is no risk. Make sense?
California Gov says yes to poisoning more children with mercury and aluminum in manditory vaccines. This corporate fascist must be stopped.
Me And Earl and The Dying Girl is a great film in so many ways. See it or you're out of the club! ;^P
Greed trumps reason again as Gov Brown moves closer to signing vaccine law in Cali. Sorry kids. It's just business. ;^[
