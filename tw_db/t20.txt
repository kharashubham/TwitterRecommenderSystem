I don't understand why people care so much about what I say in interviews? Do y'all watch the news? Don't y'all got shit to worry about?
@we_areforbidden apparently everything I say is offensive and disrespectful soooo.....
@selenagomezpps amen sister
@karaokejennjenn that's not what I said
@we_areforbidden or I get asked indirect or direct questions about her?
@plaidshirtdxys to be totally honest I don't remember ever saying that so if I did say anything my words were misunderstood
@foteiniioak not everyday. No one is every day. But I aim to be
Also don't forget that words can be taken out of context when doing interviews.. still not apologizing for saying what everyone want to say
I get asked questions. I answer them. Sue me.
