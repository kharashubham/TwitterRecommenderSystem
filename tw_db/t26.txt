Here is the lineup for the entire weekend http://t.co/HdMSKCaJMI
The Drake Homecoming film is not something OVO or Drake have any part in. I feel it is my responsibility to inform and protect my fans.
Excited to be performing for the first time ever in Dubai on March 14th at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium
