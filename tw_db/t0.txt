@piersmorgan Great article, Piers. As always. You always present a very balanced opinion.
@piersmorgan So for you it's not about whether Trunp is or isn't guilty of sexual assault, just whether he can persuade people he isn't.

A "pest"?  A fly is a pest. #Trump is a sexual predator.

@piersmorgan @MailOnline Hillary has to persuade Americans that she is not corrupt whilst #Wikileaks is proving her to be corrupt each day.
@piersmorgan @KP24 @jamestaylor20 Hales, Roy, Root, Duckett, Billings, Buttler, (Morgan?), who do we omit then for KP?
@piersmorgan US double standard.
@piersmorgan @MailOnline is it a coincidence that every time a Wikileaks is released the media runs with another Trump sex asst?
@piersmorgan @MailOnline Aussies call him a "revolting slug unfit for office". Pretty spot on #nevertrump #slug #revolting

@piersmorgan And to repeat my earlier Q: If even half the allegations turn out to be true, will you still want to be Trump's friend?
@piersmorgan @MailOnline If you have to do that maybe you shouldn't be trying to earn the position of the worlds most powerful person.
