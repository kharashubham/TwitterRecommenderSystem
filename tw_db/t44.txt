Let's add an old-timey word into our vernacular. My pick: bamboozle. 'He opened the door for me, then took my cab! I've been bamboozled!'

Thanks @awallenstein for the kind words in Variety: "..always seem to be trying so hard onstage that they risk projectile flop sweat." #ouch
Thanks, current cast of @HamiltonMusical for tonight's show. Our 5 year olds loved it - know most of the lyrics. What you do is profound.
Thanks again for putting me up this weekend @Airbnb and @Audi. Wouldn’t have
minded if it had been this house! https://t.co/FMdCVuoKmO
Thanks for the questions everyone. And for those who didn't see it, seek out Life's A Party with @Davidburtka on @FoodNetwork. It's rad.

Proud to be a NYer on this day. I still remember 9/11 in such vivid detail, first dividing and then uniting. Can't forget. #NeverForget
The twins' first day of kindergarten. So many feels: excited, nervous, giddy, wistful. But mostly proud. Can't wait to see who they become.

On this day 43 years ago - June 14th, 1973 - my mom was bustin' with baby.
So honored to have been part of the @TonyAwards2016 and @HamiltonMusical 's historic night. Great to be in the room where it happened...
The tragedy in Orlando is just beyond sad. My deepest regrets to all those suffering. There are no words that suffice. I'm...stunned.
A locked room book? I'm obsessed: Mysterious Cases contain codes, puzzles, letters, and boxes within boxes! Um, yes. https://t.co/cSihdJKKTP
Happy Memorial Day. Seems a strange adjective, happy, given the gravity of the occasion. My deep condolences to those who lost a loved one.
Happy Birthday, @Davidburtka. Every year spent with you seems better and more exciting than the last. May this grand adventure never end...
Thanks @DrWillKirby for the awesome shoutout last night on @PriceIsRight. You have great taste in words. And game shows. Much love.
I love flying home for weekends. I do. But if the ENTIRE time is spent building Star Wars LEGOS, is it worth it? Time well spent?@LEGO_Group
