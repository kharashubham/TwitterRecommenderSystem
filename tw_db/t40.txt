Power to the people. Power to the artist. Empower the artist and create a more inspired world.
Ask yourself Why did you love music in the first place and what can you do to add to the story.
Me and Drake both listen to Frank.  Radio has to support amazing artists.
Every station across the globe.  I Heart. Clear Channel local stations. Satellite. Every station.  This will make the world better.
If anyone at radio really loves music ... Come together and pick your favorite Frank Ocean song and play it at least 10 times a day.
